## Ownership
This project is solely developed by Mantas Burcikas (Newcastle University).

## Accuracy of the final model
After implementing pre-defined CNN architecture, optimisation algorithm, image data augmentation techniques and tuning general model parameters, overall model train accuracy jumped to 94%, and test accuracy reached 89%. Both train and test losses were below 0.4.

## How to run a project?
Simply open and run desired Jupyter notebook on Google Colab website or run it locally using JupyterLab.

## Summary of CNN development
In this study, I performed systematic experiments to design and train a convolutional neural network.
Throughout the development of the model, I improved CNN performance and reduced overfitting with
four different strategies: by selecting pre-defined CNN architecture, optimisation algorithm,
implementing image data augmentation and tuning general training hyper-parameters such as batch
size and the number of epochs.
